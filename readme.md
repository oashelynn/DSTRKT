## Requirements
- Instructions:
Use the 3D model of the file attached (here), implement interactive elements that provide information. The deployment of the 3D model should be visually appealing and optimized for performance.

- Requirements:
Use Three.js to create the 3D model and interactive elements.
Implement interactive elements that allow users to:
a. Rotate, zoom, or otherwise manipulate the 3D model to view it from different angles.
b. Display additional information about the marketplace when specific parts of the model are clicked or hovered over.
Ensure the 3D model and interactive elements are optimized for performance and provide a smooth user experience.

- Deliverables:
A GitHub repository containing the project's source code. 
A live demo of the 3D model and interactive elements hosted on a web server. (Can be provided upon request)

- Evaluation Criteria:
Overall functionality and completeness of the 3D model and interactive elements.
User experience, including smooth interactions and visual appeal.
Code quality, organization, and best practices.
Performance optimization techniques used.
Adherence to project requirements and instructions.
Additional Guidelines:

Use appropriate textures, lighting, and materials to enhance the visual quality of the 3D model.
Implement smooth camera controls for user interaction with the model.
Ensure the interactive elements provide clear and informative feedback to users.
Document any major design decisions or assumptions made during the development process.
